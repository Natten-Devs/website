          <h2>About Our Company</h2>
          <p>
            Natten is a team of software engineering students in Central
            Florida. Nattenâ€™s goal is to provide technical expertise and support
            for leading innovators. By offering software development services,
            Natten partners with product owners through a contract.

          <p>
            With the first ideas of Natten dating back to 2020, Natten Founder &
            CEO Carson Frankovich wanted to create a team of software
            development students collaborating on projects to gain real-world
            experience. Despite the group breaking up one year later in 2021,
            Natten made a comeback in Summer 2023 with a new business model and
            vision.
          </p>

            in Central Florida and communicate online.
